/**
 * Pure geometry maths for the camera-passthrough window. Deliberately has NO Android / OpenGL
 * dependency, so JVM unit tests can lock the two real-device regressions reported on 2026-11-09:
 *
 *  1. The window must ALWAYS be LANDSCAPE (4:3 or 16:9). The old code took the reciprocal of the
 *     preview aspect whenever the effective rotation was 90/270, which turned a normal 16:9
 *     preview into a portrait 9:16 window — the "被强制拉伸成了竖屏的 9:16 比例" report.
 *  2. Camera pixels must NEVER be stretched. When the upright content ratio and the window ratio
 *     differ, the sampled UVs are CENTRE-CROPPED instead of squeezing the quad. Rotation only ever
 *     changes what part of the buffer is sampled; it never changes the shape of the window.
 *
 * Keeping this separate from [VrTheaterRenderer] also means the rules survive a GL context loss
 * and can be verified without an emulator.
