/**
 * Pure state machine for PHYSICAL GAMEPAD input in VR mode.
 *
 * Design rules (from the user, do not "improve" these):
 *  - No gaze / eye / dwell / head-gesture activation of any kind. Head pose is view-only.
 *  - L1+R1 is ENTRY-ONLY: it opens VR, never closes it (VrSession enforces this). Exiting is a
 *    deliberate act via the phone's BACK key or the "退出 VR" menu row. START+SELECT and
 *    HOME/MODE are NOT single-press shortcuts: the
 *    settings panel opens only after a LONG PRESS (>= VrKeys.MENU_LONG_PRESS_MS) so a stray tap
 *    in game can never open it. Short presses pass straight through to the game unchanged. The
 *    hold timer starts on the initial ACTION_DOWN that completes the combination, NOT on the first
 *    OS key-repeat (see the note in onKey for why).
 *  - When the panel is open, D-pad UP/DOWN and the LEFT STICK's vertical axis BOTH select a row;
 *    LB (L1) / RB (R1) switch the second-level PAGE; A arms value editing / flips a switch;
 *    B closes the panel. D-pad LEFT/RIGHT and horizontal stick deflection are deliberately inert
 *    while disarmed (the user asked that paging NOT live on the D-pad).
 *    NUMERIC VALUES are changed ONLY by the left analogue stick AND ONLY while A has armed
 *    editing (VrMenuModel.adjustIfEditing, enforced in VrSession). Before A, the stick MUST still
 *    do something useful: real-device feedback was "摇杆上下滑动不能切换选项", because the old
 *    router emitted Adjust unconditionally and VrSession silently dropped it while disarmed.
 *  - Pads that report their D-pad as AXIS_HAT_Y instead of KEYCODE_DPAD_* are handled by onHat().
 *
 * No Android framework types are used here; VrKeys holds plain Int constants so JVM unit tests run
 * without Robolectric or mocked Android stubs.
