 * from a FOV clamped to the device params (lens_distortion.cc:189-194), so it only covers the
 * middle of the screen: the round/barrel eye windows with BLACK BANDS above/below in the user's
 * screenshot. This is the exact "之前那样" rendering and the one-click rollback.

 * FILL = "单纯放大". The SDK stereo + lens-distortion rendering is left COMPLETELY intact (both
 * eye matrices, head pose, IPD shift, barrel correction, 360° background — everything). Once it
 * has been composited onto the default framebuffer, onFinishFrame() copies that finished picture
 * into a texture and blits it back with a centred, UNIFORM zoom of [VrSettings.zoomScale]. The
 * black bands are simply pushed off the edges; both eyes grow together so they still fuse in a
 * viewer. No FOV change, no projection change, no new geometry, no shader change, no SDK C++
 * change. Only the vertical direction is GUARANTEED to fill; the horizontal edges are allowed to
 * keep a small black margin ("不是说全部填满只是上下至少要填满").

 * (VrPassthroughGeometry.bufferCrop), and the crop axes are swapped for a 90/270 turn, so no pixels
 * are ever stretched at any rotation. The status board prints the sampled ratio for on-device
 * verification.
 *
 * FOUR_THREE is the default on purpose: the vast majority of phone camera sensors are natively
 * 4:3 (e.g. 4032x3024), and a 16:9 preview is just a cropped/centre-cut of that sensor. Using
 * 4:3 therefore shows MORE of the real surroundings (especially vertically) with less crop. The
