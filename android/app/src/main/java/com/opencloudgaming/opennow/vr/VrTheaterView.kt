/**
 * Google Cardboard SDK view hosted inside MainActivity (NOT a separate Activity).
 * Keeping it in the same Activity preserves the existing NativeStreamInputRouter gamepad path.
 *
 * LAYERING — how the VR scene wins over the 2D phone stream (2026-11-07):
 *  - The app's 2D UI owns `StreamVideoSurface`, whose children are SurfaceViews. SurfaceView layers
 *    are composited by SurfaceFlinger, NOT by the Compose draw order, so VrModeHost being drawn
 *    *after* OpenNowApp does NOT put the Cardboard GL layer above the 2D stream layer. Without an
 *    explicit promotion, the 2D stream SurfaceView stays on top and "VR" looks exactly like the
 *    flat full-screen 2D picture (the reported bug).
 *  - FIX: promote the Cardboard GL SurfaceView with `setZOrderOnTop(true)`. That makes the VR GL
 *    surface the top-most surface in the window — above the 2D stream SurfaceView AND above the
 *    Compose 2D UI — so the pure-black VR scene (black clear + flat video quad) is authoritative.
 *  - TIMING IS THE WHOLE GAME. `setZOrderOnTop` only takes effect on the NEXT surface creation; if
 *    it is applied AFTER the GL surface already exists it forces a surface RE-creation, which on the
 *    OPPO F9 left the GL layer transparent (CardboardView uses RENDERMODE_WHEN_DIRTY + a Choreographer
 *    loop, so the re-created surface never got a frame and the 2D stream showed through — this was
 *    the 3cfcade failure). The glView SurfaceView child is `addView`'d inside CardboardView's own
 *    constructor (CardboardView.initialize()), i.e. BEFORE VrTheaterView.init runs, but its surface
 *    is only created later when the view is attached to the window. So we apply setZOrderOnTop(true)
 *    ONCE, in init, and never touch it again (not in onAttachedToWindow, not on settings changes).
 *  - The 2D stream SurfaceViews are deliberately LEFT ALIVE (not hidden/GONE): hiding them would
 *    destroy their native Surface and force a decoder restart / black frame on VR exit. Left alive
 *    they simply composite behind the top-most VR GL surface, which is exactly what we want.
 *
 * The SDK 2D touch overlay (alignment marker, X / gear buttons) is hidden: this project is
 * gamepad-only, and setStereoRenderMode(true) calls showAll() on that overlay, so it is re-hidden
 * after every settings change and on attach.
 *
 * DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING: every lifecycle edge logs under TAG "VrTheaterView". These are one-shot
 * events (never in the per-frame loop), so they cost nothing on a low-end device. Filter with
 * `logcat -s VrSession,VrModeHost,VrTheaterView,VrTheaterRenderer`.
