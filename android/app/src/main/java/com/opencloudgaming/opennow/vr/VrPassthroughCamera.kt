/**
 * Owns the REAL phone camera used by the VR "透视 / Passthrough" window.
 *
 * Design constraints (all deliberate):
 *
 *  1. NO WebRTC / CameraX dependency. The app already has a WebRTC-based recorder camera
 *     (`RecordingCameraCapture`) that feeds the stream; reusing it would couple passthrough to the
 *     encoder pipeline and steal the only camera client. This class uses the framework Camera2 API
 *     directly and writes frames into a [Surface] backed by the renderer's own
 *     `SurfaceTexture` (GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES) — the same zero-copy pattern as the video stream.
 *  2. All camera work happens on ONE private [HandlerThread]. `start()` / `stop()` / `release()`
 *     only post messages and never block the GL thread or the UI thread. Camera2 callbacks are
 *     delivered to that same handler, so the state machine has no cross-thread races.
 *  3. FAILURE IS NEVER FATAL. Missing CAMERA permission, no matching lens, a busy device (e.g. the
 *     stream is already recording from the camera), or any CameraAccessException is reported via
 *     [Listener.onUnavailable]; the renderer then simply keeps the original pure-black / 360°
 *     background. VR never black-screens or crashes because of passthrough.
 *  4. [generation] invalidates late asynchronous callbacks: after stop()/release(), an in-flight
 *     `onOpened` closes the device instead of opening a session on a dead surface.
 *
 * 2026-11-09 real-device fix (方向错 / 直接拉伸 / 缺分辨率与帧率):
 *  - Old code hardcoded `setDefaultBufferSize(1280x960 / 1280x720)` in the renderer and built the
 *    window quad from a GUESSED 4:3 / 16:9 ratio. Camera2 only ever outputs sizes it advertises
 *    in StreamConfigurationMap, so the real buffer ratio often differed from the quad and the
 *    picture was visibly stretched. Now THIS class picks the real size, applies it to the
 *    SurfaceTexture before session creation (so getTransformMatrix() carries no crop), and reports
 *    the REAL width/height/frame-rate/rotation through Listener.onPreviewConfig; the renderer
 *    builds a LANDSCAPE, centre-cropped quad from those exact numbers (see VrPassthroughGeometry).
 *    Rotation NEVER changes the window shape — that was the portrait 9:16 regression.
 *  - Resolution tiers (360P/480P/720P/1080P) and frame-rate tiers (15/30/60) are requested through
 *    VrPassthroughResolution / VrPassthroughFrameRate. The frame rate is written into
 *    CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE from CONTROL_AE_AVAILABLE_TARGET_FPS_RANGES; a 30 fps-only phone
 *    silently falls back to 30 and the effective value is reported back for the status panel.
 *
 * 2026-11-10 real-device fix ("已经开了摄像头的翻转...但比例有拉伸"):
 *  - centreCrop() returns keep-fractions in UPRIGHT CONTENT axes, but the renderer applies them
 *    AFTER rotating the UVs into raw-buffer axes. A 90/270 turn TRANSPOSES those axes, so the
 *    fractions must be swapped (VrPassthroughGeometry.bufferCrop()). Without that, a manually
 *    upright picture is still stretched even though the window itself is correctly landscape.
 *  - normaliseLandscape() was removed: rewriting an advertised 720x1280 buffer as "1280x720"
 *    made the camera and renderer disagree about which axis was wide. The real W/H is now
 *    reported verbatim; VrPassthroughGeometry handles portrait buffers and keeps the window
 *    landscape. The status board prints the sampled ratio so this is checkable on-device.
 *
 * The camera is ALWAYS released when the VR host leaves the composition (see
 * VrTheaterRenderer.onRendererShutdown), so the stream's own camera recording can take it back.
